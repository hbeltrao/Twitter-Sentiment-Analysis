# Project to extract data from Twitter and present in Tableau



This repository contains the tools I used to connect to the Twitter API and extract data of tweets related to the brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, save those data into a Mongo database hosted in the internet, a script to access this database and process ETL before feed the data into Tableau and create the dashboard.
